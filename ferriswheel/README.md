# Ferris Wheel Animation

This project is a CSS animation of a Ferris wheel with rotating cabins.

## Features

- Circular Ferris wheel with six spokes (lines).
- Six cabins positioned evenly around the wheel.
- Continuous rotation animation for the wheel.
- Cabins swing back and forth with a smooth swinging animation.
- Color-changing cabins during the animation cycle.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (including CSS animations and transforms)
- (Optional) JavaScript (if you want to extend functionality)

## How It Works

- The `.wheel` div represents the Ferris wheel with six `.line` spans as spokes.
- Six `.cabin` divs are positioned around the wheel using CSS positioning.
- CSS `@keyframes` are used to animate:
  - The wheel’s rotation (`wheel` animation).
  - The cabins’ swinging motion (`cabins` animation).
- The cabins change colors between red, yellow, and purple during the swing animation for visual effect.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Watch the Ferris wheel rotate with swinging cabins.

## Optional Enhancements

- Add JavaScript controls to start/stop the animation.
- Add sound effects or interactive features.
- Make the wheel responsive to user input or screen size.
