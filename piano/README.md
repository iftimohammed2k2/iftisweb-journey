# ðŸŽ¹ Responsive Piano UI

A responsive piano interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” created as part of a front-end development challenge to showcase layout responsiveness and interactivity.

*(Replace this with a real screenshot of your piano if you want.)*

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- Fully responsive layout using `@media` queries
- Dynamic resizing for mobile, tablet, and desktop widths
- Simulated piano keys with styled white and black keys
- Placeholder JavaScript for future sound or key press interactivity

## ðŸ“± Responsive Design

| Viewport Width       | Piano Width | Keys Width |
|----------------------|-------------|------------|
| â‰¤ 768px              | 358px       | 318px      |
| 769px - 1199px       | 675px       | 633px      |
| â‰¥ 1200px (default)   | 992px       | 949px      |

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- The layout uses CSS Flexbox and float-based key alignment.
- Media queries adjust piano and key sizes based on viewport width.
- JavaScript adds basic click interaction to each key (`console.log()` message for now).
